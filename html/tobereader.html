<p>This is not a regular book with a single subject. It is not even a conglomeration of different essays cleverly brought together by an intelligent editor. It may be more akin to an inscrutable word formed mysteriously by the letters accidentally falling from a word-building set kept on a table! Its only merit is that it is in Sanskrit and printed in Devanagari script!</p>
<p>These writings were spread over a long period of 55 years (1960-2015). Most of them have been printed also, sometimes with translations.</p>
<p>The idea of bringing them together is more out of fancy than the illusion that is may be useful someday to somebody!</p>
<p>The essays -short and long -as also the various books, have been brought together into a single volume with some sort of orderliness to aviod its being labelled `disarrayed'.</p>
<p>The only hope is that lovers of Sanskrit like you who may happen to glance through it, may exclaim, `not bad!'</p>
<p>As for myself, it is a standing monument of Divine Grace as pictured in the Mukrndamala Mukam Karoti Vacalam]</p>
